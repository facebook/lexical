/**
 * Emit specialized `exportJSON`, `updateFromJSON` and `afterCloneFrom`
 * implementations for the node classes in {@link MANIFEST}, from the same
 * serialization schema those classes declare, using `@lexical/compiler`'s
 * SchemaJsonCodegen pass.
 *
 * Both schema-driven paths walk a compiled table per node: a loop, an indirect
 * call per property, and a keyed store whose key changes every iteration.
 * Everything they decide — which accessor to use, what the node's type string
 * is, what each property's domain admits — is fixed once the schema is written,
 * so it can be decided here instead and emitted as straight-line code. That is
 * what the hand-written methods this schema replaced used to be, recovered
 * without hand-writing them.
 *
 * Each package gets its own generated module beside its nodes, and each class
 * passes its own generated code to `$config`, so the association is carried by
 * the class rather than derived from its type string; a subclass whose
 * accessor tables compile the same way inherits it, which is why `type` is
 * read off the node rather than emitted as a literal. The compact form
 * compares each property against its default; a reference-typed default has no
 * literal a value could be `===`, so it gets the structural test the schema's
 * own equality reduces to where that can be stated (MarkNode's `ids`, an empty
 * array), and where it cannot be stated the property is simply written rather
 * than omitted — the omission is the optimization, and one property that
 * cannot justify it should not cost its siblings theirs.
 *
 * The import direction is the untrusted-JSON boundary and has to reproduce
 * each property's validation exactly, so every emitted parser is checked here
 * against the schema it was compiled from, over a corpus derived from that
 * schema plus a fixed set of hostile values. A property whose schema this
 * cannot compile — or compiles wrongly — takes the class out of the import
 * half rather than shipping a parser that disagrees with the walk.
 *
 * `afterCloneFrom` is the third direction, and the one whose fallback is not
 * the walk: a class that declares schema fields gets one synthesized at
 * registration whether or not it is generated here, because a field is where a
 * property is stored and a clone that drops it loses the value silently. What
 * is emitted is that same field list as straight-line assignments, so a class
 * generated here pays no loop for it.
 *
 * Reading a schema needs no editor and constructs no node: `$config()` is a
 * plain method on the prototype, so this runs as an ordinary build step.
 *
 * This module is the generation itself. `scripts/generate-node-json.mjs` runs
 * it (`pnpm run generate-node-json`) after a stub phase that keeps the imports
 * loadable, and `LexicalGeneratedJSON.test.ts` runs it in-process into a
 * temporary directory and fails if any checked-in output is stale or
 * disagrees with the schema-driven path.
