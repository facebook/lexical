# Named Slots

:::warning

Named slots are experimental. The APIs described here are tagged
`@experimental`, may change without a major version bump, and the
serialization and collab formats should be treated as unstable until the
feature is stabilized.

:::

Named slots let a single host node (an ElementNode or a DecoratorNode) own
several isolated editable regions addressed by name — a Card's `title`, a
PullQuote's `quote` and `attribution` — inside the host's own EditorState.
Each region takes its own caret and formatting, never merges across the
boundary, and `Cmd+A` doesn't spill into the rest of the document.

Before named slots, the usual answer was a nested editor per region: every
region lives in its own EditorState, so moving nodes between regions and
keeping history and collab in sync all require serialization and extra
`editor.update` passes. The other node shapes don't fit either: plain
ElementNode children share one undivided linked list (Backspace at a region
start merges it into the previous region), and a DecoratorNode is atomic, so
Lexical can't own selection, collab, or serialization inside it. With named
slots, editing a slot is just editing the one tree.

:::note

Named slots are the model-level generalization of the rendering concept
behind [`$getDOMSlot`](/docs/api/modules/lexical#getdomslot) /
`ElementDOMSlot` in the
[DOM rendering](../serialization/dom-render.md) documentation. Every
ElementNode already has one _unnamed_ children channel, and `$getDOMSlot`
controls where that channel's content attaches in the node's DOM. Named
slots are additional, explicitly-named channels alongside it — symmetric in
that each renders into a controllable location in the host's DOM — but they
also carry the model-level semantics the unnamed channel doesn't: isolation
(the virtual shadow root below), a separate NodeKey map, and their own
serialization and collaboration.

:::

## The Model

A host keeps a second child channel, a `Map` of slot name to NodeKey,
separate from its ordinary linked-list children. A slot value has its slot
host pointer set and `getParent() === null`, with exactly one of the two
non-null: `getParent()` stops at the slot boundary, and you climb out only
through [`$getSlotHost()`](/docs/api/modules/lexical#getslothost).

The slot link itself acts as a **virtual invisible shadow root** between the
host and the value. Isolation is structural rather than a convention — an
accidental boundary crossing surfaces as a thrown invariant, not silent
corruption.

In the DOM, each value renders synchronously into a keyless
`<div data-lexical-slot="<name>">` container parked slots-first in the host
DOM as a **hidden placeholder** (`display: none`), in a canonical order
derived from the host class (see [slot order](#slot-order)). Nothing is
visible until the host explicitly attaches the container somewhere (see
[Rendering](#rendering)) — mirroring how
[`getDOMSlot`](/docs/api/modules/lexical#getdomslot) gives an element
control over where its linked-list children render.

## Hosts and Values

Any ElementNode or DecoratorNode can host slots. An ElementNode host can mix
slots with ordinary children (a Card with a `title` slot plus regular body
paragraphs); a DecoratorNode host has no children channel, so slots are its
only editable content (a PullQuote that is otherwise atomic).

A slot value is any non-inline ElementNode or DecoratorNode. The value's
shape decides the editing model:

- **A bare block** (for example a ParagraphNode) behaves as a single-line
  field with no extra wrapper in the model, the JSON, or the DOM: its virtual
  scope holds exactly one block, so Enter is a no-op (hosts may map it to
  focus movement) and a multi-block paste flattens to inline content the way
  an `<input>` sanitizes its value — line breaks stripped, block-only
  decorators dropped.
- **A shadow-root container** (an ElementNode whose
  [`isShadowRoot()`](/docs/api/modules/lexical#isshadowroot) returns
  `true`) behaves as a multi-block region with normal block editing inside.

## Declaring and Setting Slots

A host class declares its slot names in [`$config()`](nodes.mdx); values are
attached with [`$setSlot`](/docs/api/modules/lexical#setslot):

```ts
import {
  $create,
  $createParagraphNode,
  $setSlot,
  ElementNode,
} from 'lexical';

class CardNode extends ElementNode {
  $config() {
    return this.config('card', {extends: ElementNode, slots: ['title']});
  }
  createDOM(): HTMLElement {
    return document.createElement('div');
  }
  updateDOM(): boolean {
    return false;
  }
}

function $createCardNode(): CardNode {
  const card = $create(CardNode);
  // Single-line title: the bare paragraph IS the slot value. An empty
  // paragraph is an empty field; to seed default text, append a non-empty
  // TextNode (empty TextNodes are eliminated during reconciliation).
  $setSlot(card, 'title', $createParagraphNode());
  // Ordinary body child, edited like any other block.
  return card.append($createParagraphNode());
}
```

For a multi-block region, use a shadow-root container as the value:

```ts
class SlotContainerNode extends ElementNode {
  $config() {
    return this.config('slot-container', {extends: ElementNode});
  }
  createDOM(): HTMLElement {
    return document.createElement('div');
  }
  updateDOM(): boolean {
    return false;
  }
  isShadowRoot(): boolean {
    return true;
  }
}

$setSlot(
  pullQuote,
  'quote',
  $create(SlotContainerNode).append(
    $createParagraphNode().append($createTextNode('First block')),
    $createParagraphNode().append($createTextNode('Second block')),
  ),
);
```

The core API surface (all exported from `lexical`):

- [`$setSlot(host, name, node)`](/docs/api/modules/lexical#setslot) — place a value into a named slot, replacing
  any existing value under that name. Move semantics, mirroring `append`:
  the value is detached from any current parent or slot first. Throws if the
  value is inline or if the name is one of the reserved prototype keys
  (`__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype`). Slotting a node into its own
  descendant would form a cycle; this is checked (and throws) in development
  only — in production it behaves like appending an ancestor through the
  children channel, which is likewise unguarded.
- [`$getSlot(host, name)`](/docs/api/modules/lexical#getslot) — the value under a name, or `null`.
- [`$getSlotNames(host)`](/docs/api/modules/lexical#getslotnames) — the host's slot names in canonical order.
- [`$removeSlot(host, name)`](/docs/api/modules/lexical#removeslot) — detach the value under a name (the subtree is
  garbage-collected unless you reattach it elsewhere).
- [`$getSlotHost(node)`](/docs/api/modules/lexical#getslothost) — the host a value is slotted into, or `null`.
- [`$getSlotFrame(node)`](/docs/api/modules/lexical#getslotframe) — the innermost slot value containing a node (the
  "frame" whose virtual shadow root scopes editing), or `null` when the node
  is not inside any slot.
- [`$isSlotHost(node)`](/docs/api/modules/lexical#isslothost) /
  [`$isSlotChild(node)`](/docs/api/modules/lexical#isslotchild) — type guards
  for the [`SlotHostNode`](/docs/api/modules/lexical#slothostnode) /
  [`SlotChildNode`](/docs/api/modules/lexical#slotchildnode) interfaces.

## Slot Order

Slot order is canonical and derived, never stored. Names declared in
`$config()` (`slots: ['quote', 'attribution']`) sort first in declaration
order; undeclared names sort after them, lexicographically by UTF-16 code
unit (plain JavaScript string comparison, locale-independent). `$setSlot`
re-canonicalizes on every write, so documents normalize on load and
concurrent collaborative additions converge to the same order on every
client. If presentation order matters, declare the names.

## Rendering

The reconciler always renders every slot subtree synchronously, but into a
hidden placeholder container — visibility is the host's explicit decision.
There are three ways to attach a slot, all sharing the same contract
(attaching moves the container to the target, a no-op when it is already
there, and reveals it; the container renders as a normal block):

1. **Synchronously in-lexical**: register a `$getSlotTargetElement`
   [`DOMRenderMatch`](/docs/api/modules/lexical_html#domrendermatch)
   override for the host's node class (a
   [DOM render override](../serialization/dom-render.md), not a node
   method — this is an advanced hook). The reconciler consults it whenever
   it creates or reconciles the slot's container and attaches/reveals
   within the same commit — no listener or framework hop. Returning
   `hostDom` reveals the slot in its default slots-first position:

   ```ts
   import {domOverride, DOMRenderExtension} from '@lexical/html';
   import {configExtension, defineExtension} from 'lexical';

   export const CardExtension = defineExtension({
     dependencies: [
       configExtension(DOMRenderExtension, {
         overrides: [
           domOverride([CardNode], {
             // Reveal the title in its default slots-first position within
             // the same commit that renders it. Returning an element from
             // deeper inside the host's DOM attaches it there instead;
             // $next() defers to lower-priority overrides (default: null,
             // a hidden placeholder).
             $getSlotTargetElement: (node, slotName, hostDom, $next) =>
               hostDom,
           }),
         ],
       }),
     ],
     name: 'card',
     nodes: [CardNode],
   });
   ```

2. **Imperatively**:
   [`mountSlotContainer(editor, nodeKey, slotName, target)`](/docs/api/modules/lexical#mountslotcontainer)
   and
   [`unmountSlotContainer(editor, nodeKey, container)`](/docs/api/modules/lexical#unmountslotcontainer)
   from `lexical` are the framework-independent primitives (e.g. from a
   [mutation listener](/docs/api/modules/lexical#registermutationlistener)).
   They read through
   [`editor.readPending`](/docs/api/modules/lexical#readpending),
   so calling them mid-update
   observes the pending state without forcing a flush:

   ```ts
   import {mountSlotContainer} from 'lexical';

   // e.g. inside an extension's register(editor):
   const unregister = editor.registerMutationListener(
     CardNode,
     (mutations) => {
       for (const [nodeKey, mutation] of mutations) {
         if (mutation === 'destroyed') {
           continue;
         }
         const hostDom = editor.getElementByKey(nodeKey);
         if (hostDom !== null) {
           // Mounting in place: the placeholder is already parked in the
           // host DOM, so this just reveals it in its slots-first position.
           // Any element within the host's DOM works as a target.
           mountSlotContainer(editor, nodeKey, 'title', hostDom);
         }
       }
     },
     {skipInitialization: false},
   );
   ```

   `unmountSlotContainer(editor, nodeKey, container)` is the reverse: it
   hides the container and parks it back in the host DOM, for when a mount
   target goes away while the host remains.

3. **From React chrome**: the
   [`useLexicalSlotRef`](/docs/api/modules/lexical_react_useLexicalSlotRef#uselexicalslotref)
   hook from `@lexical/react/useLexicalSlotRef` wraps the imperative pair and returns a
   ref that mounts a slot's container into your component — the usual choice
   for a DecoratorNode host's `decorate()` chrome (whose containers are
   opted back into `contentEditable` automatically, since the decorator DOM
   is non-editable):

```tsx
import {useLexicalComposerContext} from '@lexical/react/LexicalComposerContext';
import {useLexicalSlotRef} from '@lexical/react/useLexicalSlotRef';

function PullQuoteComponent({nodeKey}: {nodeKey: NodeKey}) {
  const [editor] = useLexicalComposerContext();
  const quoteRef = useLexicalSlotRef<HTMLDivElement>(editor, nodeKey, 'quote');
  const attributionRef = useLexicalSlotRef<HTMLDivElement>(
    editor,
    nodeKey,
    'attribution',
  );
  return (
    <blockquote>
      <div ref={quoteRef} />
      <div ref={attributionRef} />
    </blockquote>
  );
}
```

A `contentEditable=false` ElementNode shell can host React chrome the same
way (slot containers opt into editing whenever the host DOM is
non-editable): the playground's Panel demo portals chrome into the host DOM,
attaches the title slot with `useLexicalSlotRef`, and applies the identical
hidden-then-attach technique to its `getDOMSlot` children element. Such a shell should call
[`setDOMUnmanaged(dom)`](/docs/api/modules/lexical#setdomunmanaged) in
`createDOM` — the portal and the
attach moves mutate the shell's children from outside the reconciler, and
the marker gives the shell the same mutation-observer exemption a
DecoratorNode's DOM has.

## Editing Behavior

- **Selection never crosses a slot boundary.** Selections are clamped to the
  anchor's slot frame at every entry point (DOM resolution,
  [`$setSelection`](/docs/api/modules/lexical#setselection),
  and point mutation), so a mouse drag and a `shift+arrow` across the
  boundary land on the same clamped result.
- **Deletion stops at the boundary.** Backspace at the start of a slot and
  forward-Delete at its end are no-ops instead of merging across the virtual
  shadow root.
- **`Cmd+A` scopes to the slot frame** when the caret is inside one; outside
  slots the default handlers keep the legacy whole-document behavior.
  Progressive expansion (block → enclosing slot frame → document on repeated
  presses) is provided by the opt-in
  [`SelectBlockExtension`](/docs/api/modules/lexical_extension#selectblockextension)
  from `@lexical/extension`.
- **A NodeSelection of an element carries its children.** Copy and export
  of a whole-host NodeSelection (e.g. a chrome click that selects "the whole
  Card") include the host's body children even though they aren't in the
  selection themselves — the old shell-only output made cut silently lossy.
  This applies only to NodeSelection; a partial RangeSelection over the host
  keeps per-child slicing.

### Traversal is intentionally asymmetric

Content reads include slot subtrees, slots-first:
[`getTextContent()`](/docs/api/modules/lexical#gettextcontent),
[`getAllTextNodes()`](/docs/api/modules/lexical#getalltextnodes),
and the [`$dfsWithSlots`](/docs/api/modules/lexical_utils#dfswithslots)
family in `@lexical/utils` count slot content for search, copy, and
accessibility. Navigation excludes them:
[`getChildren()`](/docs/api/modules/lexical#getchildren),
[`getFirstDescendant()`](/docs/api/modules/lexical#getfirstdescendant)
and friends stay linked-list-only, so caret movement never walks into a slot
by accident. Choose [`$dfs`](/docs/api/modules/lexical_utils#dfs) or
[`$dfsWithSlots`](/docs/api/modules/lexical_utils#dfswithslots) depending on whether "this subtree" should mean the
navigable tree or all content.

## Serialization

JSON serialization is automatic in both directions. A host's slots serialize
under the reserved `$slots` key on
[`SerializedLexicalNode`](/docs/api/modules/lexical#serializedlexicalnode)
(a sibling of
NodeState's reserved `'$'` key), keyed by slot name:

```json
{
  "type": "card",
  "version": 1,
  "$slots": {
    "title": {"type": "paragraph", "children": [], "version": 1}
  },
  "children": []
}
```

Parsing re-attaches each subtree with `$setSlot` and throws if `$slots`
appears on a node that cannot host slots. The `$` prefix keeps the
framework-owned key from colliding with a subclass that already serializes a
`slots` property of its own.

HTML serialization is opt-in per host, like NodeState: the exporter never
descends into slots on its own. A host's `exportDOM` can emit each slot into
a wrapper using
[`$appendNodeToHTML`](/docs/api/modules/lexical_html#appendnodetohtml) from
`@lexical/html`, and a
[DOM import rule](../serialization/dom-import.md) on the host's
distinguishing markup maps the wrappers back through `$setSlot`.

## Collaboration

Slots sync on both the V1 and V2 Yjs bindings through a per-slot-diffed
`Y.Map` stored under the reserved `slots` attribute key on the host's shared
type. Hosts with declared slots create that map eagerly, so two clients
concurrently setting *different* slot names for the first time merge
per-entry instead of racing. Malformed or hostile remote entries are
validated and skipped.

:::caution

Pre-slots clients receiving slot data from upgraded peers will error rather
than render it. Enabling slots in long-lived shared documents should be
gated on all participants running a slots-aware version; new clients
tolerate unknown slot data going forward.

:::

## Reserved Names

Adding slots reserves a few identifiers that custom node subclasses should
not define for their own purposes:

- the `__slots` and `__slotHost` fields on ElementNode / DecoratorNode;
- the `$slots` serialized JSON key;
- the bare `slots` collab attribute key — a custom node field literally
  named `slots` no longer syncs over collab.

## Current Limitations

- The caret / NodeCaret APIs throw across a slot boundary ("no common
  ancestor"); slot-aware caret traversal is a planned follow-up.
- Nested slots (a slot whose host is itself slotted) are only handled one
  level deep by the runtime selection comparator.
- The mixed-version collab caveat above.
