# `@lexical/plain-text`

This package provides a starting point for Lexical users by registering listeners for a set of basic commands that cover simple text-editing behavior such as entering text, deleting characters, copy + paste, or changing the selection with arrow keys.

You can use this package as a starting point, and then add additional command listeners to customize the functionality of your editor. If you want to add rich-text features, such as headings, blockquotes, or formatted text, you may want to consider using [@lexical/rich-text](https://lexical.dev/docs/packages/lexical-rich-text) instead.
