# `@lexical/eslint-plugin`

This ESLint plugin enforces the [Lexical $function convention](https://lexical.dev/docs/intro#reading-and-updating-editor-state).

**ESLint Compatibility:** This plugin supports ESLint 7, 8, 9, and 10+. Both legacy (`.eslintrc`) and flat config (`eslint.config.js`) formats are supported.

## Installation

Assuming you already have ESLint installed, run:

```sh
npm install @lexical/eslint-plugin --save-dev
```

### ESLint 9+ (Flat Config)

If you're using ESLint 9 or later with the new flat config format (required in ESLint 10+), add this to your `eslint.config.js`:

```js
import lexical from '@lexical/eslint-plugin';

export default [
  // ... other configs
  lexical.configs['flat/recommended']
];
```

### ESLint 7-8 (Legacy Config)

For ESLint 7 or 8 with the legacy `.eslintrc` format, extend the recommended config:

```js
{
  "extends": [
    // ...
    "plugin:@lexical/legacy-recommended"
  ]
}
```

> **Note:** The unprefixed `recommended` and `all` configs are legacy aliases.
> Use `flat/recommended` or `flat/all` with ESLint 9+. The default presets enable
> `@lexical/rules-of-lexical` and `@lexical/no-nested-editor-updates` as
> warnings. `@lexical/no-document-in-dom-methods` remains opt-in because it is
> specific to Lexical DOM method implementations.

### Custom Configuration

#### ESLint 9+ (Flat Config)

```js
import lexical from '@lexical/eslint-plugin';

export default [
  {
    plugins: {
      '@lexical': lexical
    },
    rules: {
      '@lexical/rules-of-lexical': 'error'
    }
  }
];
```

#### ESLint 7-8 (Legacy Config)

```js
{
  "plugins": [
    // ...
    "@lexical"
  ],
  "rules": {
    // ...
    "@lexical/rules-of-lexical": "error"
  }
}
```

### Preventing nested editor updates

`@lexical/no-nested-editor-updates` reports `editor.update()` calls that are
already inside an update context for the same editor. This includes callbacks
passed directly to `editor.update`, `editor.registerCommand`, and
`editor.registerNodeTransform` when the outer and inner receiver can be tied to
the same expression and identifier binding.

The rule also reports a same-editor update directly inside `editor.read()`,
including the `editor.read(mode, callback)` overload. A read callback is
read-only, so this diagnostic does not suggest removing the wrapper. It explains
that the update is deferred until the read returns and should be moved after the
read callback.

The rule also reports an `editor.update()` directly inside a $function. In
that case the diagnostic explains both valid fixes: remove the update wrapper
if the function uses the active editor context, or remove the `$` prefix if the
function intentionally owns the update.

The default presets enable the rule as a warning. You can promote it to an error
or turn it off in the `rules` object in either configuration format:

```js
const rules = {
  '@lexical/no-nested-editor-updates': 'error'
};
```

For example, this command listener schedules a nested update:

```js
editor.registerCommand(
  REMOVE_NODE_COMMAND,
  () => {
    editor.update(() => {
      $getSelection().removeText();
    });
    return true;
  },
  COMMAND_PRIORITY_EDITOR,
);
```

The listener already has an implicit update context, so the callback should run
directly:

```js
editor.registerCommand(
  REMOVE_NODE_COMMAND,
  () => {
    $getSelection().removeText();
    return true;
  },
  COMMAND_PRIORITY_EDITOR,
);
```

A nested update in a read callback must retain its wrapper, but it should run
after the read:

```js
const shouldRemove = editor.read('latest', () => {
  return $getSelection()?.isCollapsed() === false;
});

if (shouldRemove) {
  editor.update(() => {
    $getSelection()?.removeText();
  });
}
```

An update to a different editor is valid and is not reported:

```js
editor.registerCommand(
  SYNC_CHILD_COMMAND,
  () => {
    childEditor.update(() => {
      $getRoot().clear();
    });
    return true;
  },
  COMMAND_PRIORITY_EDITOR,
);
```

When a nested update has a statically analyzable `options` object, the diagnostic
also explains how to preserve options that can be applied to the current update
context: use `$addUpdateTag` for `tag`, `$flushSyncAfterUpdate` for `discrete`,
and `$onUpdate` for `onUpdate`, then remove the wrapper. Call `$addUpdateTag`
once for each value when `tag` is an array.

`skipTransforms` has no in-place equivalent. The rule therefore leaves alone
options objects containing `skipTransforms` as well as identifiers, spreads,
computed properties, and unknown properties that might hide it. Options on an
update inside `read()` are preserved unchanged when that update is moved after
the read callback.

To avoid matching unrelated APIs that also have an `update` method, editor
expressions must end in `editor`, ignoring case. This recognizes names such as
`editor`, `childEditor`, `props.editor`, `$getEditor()`, and `this.editor`, but
callback checks report only when the inner expression can be tied to the outer
expression. `this.editor` is treated as the same receiver across an arrow
callback, where `this` is lexical; it is not assumed to be the same across an
ordinary function callback.

Inside a $function, the default active-editor names are `editor` and
`$getEditor()`; differently named receivers are left alone because they may
refer to another editor. Additional names or patterns can be configured with
`isEditor`. The `isDollarFunction` option extends the default `/^\$[a-z_]/`
function-name matcher:

```js
const rules = {
  '@lexical/no-nested-editor-updates': [
    'error',
    {
      isDollarFunction: '^INTERNAL_\\$',
      isEditor: ['^lexicalInstance$', '^getMyEditor$'],
    },
  ],
};
```

Configured zero-argument accessors are compared consistently, so repeated
`getMyEditor()` calls in the same direct callback are recognized as the same
editor expression.

The analysis is deliberately local. It does not follow callbacks passed by
reference, aliases between differently named editor variables, or updates
inside another nested callback such as `setTimeout(() => editor.update(...))`.
These limits avoid suggestions that could change behavior when the editor or
execution context cannot be proven statically.

### Advanced configuration

Most of the heuristics in `@lexical/rules-of-lexical` can be extended with
additional terms or patterns.

The code example below is shown using the default implementations for each
option. When you configure these they are combined with the default
implementations using "OR", the default implementations can not be overridden.
These terms and patterns are only shown for reference and pasting this example
into your project is not useful.

If the string begins with a `"^"` or `"("` then it is treated as a RegExp,
otherwise it will be an exact match. A string may also be used instead
of an array of strings.

#### ESLint 9+ (Flat Config)

```js
import lexical from '@lexical/eslint-plugin';

export default [
  {
    plugins: {
      '@lexical': lexical
    },
    rules: {
      '@lexical/rules-of-lexical': [
        'error',
        {
          isDollarFunction: ['^\\$[a-z_]'],
          isIgnoredFunction: [],
          isLexicalProvider: [
            'parseEditorState',
            'read',
            'registerCommand',
            'registerNodeTransform',
            'update'
          ],
          isSafeDollarFunction: ['^\\$is']
        }
      ]
    }
  }
];
```

#### ESLint 7-8 (Legacy Config)

```js
{
  "plugins": [
    // ...
    "@lexical"
  ],
  "rules": {
    // ...
    "@lexical/rules-of-lexical": [
      "error",
      {
        "isDollarFunction": ["^\\$[a-z_]"],
        "isIgnoredFunction": [],
        "isLexicalProvider": [
          "parseEditorState",
          "read",
          "registerCommand",
          "registerNodeTransform",
          "update"
        ],
        "isSafeDollarFunction": ["^\\$is"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### `isDollarFunction`

*Base case*: `/^\$[a-z_]/`

This defines the \$function convention, which by default is any function that
starts with a dollar sign followed by a lowercase latin letter. You may have a
secondary convention in your codebase, such as non-latin letters, or an
internal prefix that you want to consider (e.g. `"^INTERNAL_\\$"`).

#### `isIgnoredFunction`

*Base case*: None

Functions that match these patterns are ignored from analysis, they may call
Lexical \$functions but are not considered to be a dollar function themselves.

#### `isLexicalProvider`

*Base case*: `/^(parseEditorState|read|registerCommand|registerNodeTransform|update)$/`

These are functions that allow their function argument to use Lexical
\$functions.

#### `isSafeDollarFunction`

*Base case*: `/^\$is/`

These \$functions are considered safe to call from anywhere, generally
these functions are runtime type checks that do not depend on any other
state.

## Testing

To verify that the plugin works with different ESLint versions, run the integration tests:

```bash
node packages/lexical-eslint-plugin/__tests__/integration-test.js
```

This will test:
- ✓ ESLint 8 with legacy `.eslintrc.json` configuration
- ✓ ESLint 10 with flat `eslint.config.js` configuration
- ✓ Legacy config name aliases (`recommended` vs `legacy-recommended`)

The tests use `pnpm dlx` to run different ESLint versions without modifying `package.json` or `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

## Valid and Invalid Examples

### Valid Examples

\$functions may be called by other \$functions

```js
function $namedCorrectly() {
  return $getRoot();
}
```

\$functions may be called in functions defined when calling the following
methods (the heuristic only considers the method name):

* `editor.update`
* `editorState.read`
* `editor.registerCommand`
* `editor.registerNodeTransform`

```js
function validUsesEditorOrState(editor) {
  editor.update(() => $getRoot());
  editor.getLatestState().read(() => $getRoot());
}
```

\$functions may be called from class methods

```js
class CustomNode extends ElementNode {
  appendText(string) {
    this.appendChild($createTextNode(string));
  }
}
```

### Invalid Examples

#### Rename autofix

```js
function invalidFunction() {
  return $getRoot();
}
function $callsInvalidFunction() {
  return invalidFunction();
}
```

*Autofix:* The function is renamed with a $ prefix. Any references to this
name in this module are also always renamed.

```js
function $invalidFunction() {
  return $getRoot();
}
function $callsInvalidFunction() {
  return $invalidFunction();
}
```

#### Rename & deprecate autofix

```js
export function exportedInvalidFunction() {
  return $getRoot();
}
```

*Autofix:* The exported function is renamed with a $ prefix. The previous name
is also exported and marked deprecated, because automatic renaming of
references to that name is limited to the module's scope.

```js
export function $exportedInvalidFunction() {
  return $getRoot();
}
/** @deprecated renamed to {@link $exportedInvalidFunction} by @lexical/eslint-plugin rules-of-lexical */
export const exportedInvalidFunction = $exportedInvalidFunction;
```

#### Rename scope conflict

```js
import {$getRoot} from 'lexical';
function InvalidComponent() {
  const [editor] = useLexicalComposerContext();
  const getRoot = useCallback(() => $getRoot(), []);
  return (<button onClick={() => editor.update(() => getRoot())} />);
}
```

*Autofix:* The function is renamed with a $ prefix and _ suffix since the suggested name was already in scope.

```js
import {$getRoot} from 'lexical';
function InvalidComponent() {
  const [editor] = useLexicalComposerContext();
  const $getRoot_ = useCallback(() => $getRoot(), []);
  return (<button onClick={() => editor.update(() => $getRoot_())} />);
}
```
