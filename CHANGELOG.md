## 0.1.13 (March 02, 2022)

- Moved appropriate NPM peer dependencies to dependencies. I.e. @lexical/clipboard will now be fetched automatically when using @lexical/react.
- Simplified LexicalNestedComposer props to inherit parent when possible.
- SSR fixes.

## 0.1.12 (February 28, 2022)

- Added TypeScript definitions for lexical and @lexical/react
- LexicalComposer and createEditor now take a mandatory onError prop.
- createEditor can now take an optional readOnly prop.
- Moved LexicalEventHelpers to @lexical/clipboard.
- Minor selection fixes.

## 0.1.11 (February 24, 2022)

- Added GridSelection to support table selection. Selection is now `null | RangeSelection | GridSelection | NodeSelection`.
- The editor now natively supports read only mode. Use `editor.setReadOnly(boolean)` and `editor.isReadOnly()` to find the read only mode.
- An additional listener has been added to support listening to readonly changes. Use `editor.addListener('readonly', value => {... })` to react to read only mode changes.
- The BootstrapPlugin has been removed. Instead now use the `initialEditorState` prop on either the PlainTextPlugin or RichTextPlugin to initialize editor state.

## 0.1.10 (February 22, 2022)

- Added NodeSelection to support multiple non-adjacent node selection. Selection is now `null | RangeSelection | NodeSelection`. Upgrade note: `selection !== null` -> `$isRangeSelection(selection)`.
- HTML to DOM conversion has been to moved to the nodes themselves. Nodes now take an optional `static convertDOM(): DOMConversionMap | null`.
- When onError is not passed to `createEditor({onError})` errors will now throw by default. Also, removed `addListener('error')`.
- Fixed BootstrapPlugin race condition.

## 0.1.9 (February 18, 2022)

- Added `addListener('mutation', Class<LexicalNode>, Map<NodeKey, NodeMutation>)` to track created/destroyed nodes. `NodeMutation = 'created' | 'destroyed'`
- Removed `$log()`.
- Moved TableNode/Row/Cell to its own `@lexical/table` package.
- Composition fixes.

## 0.1.8 (February 11, 2022)

- `Lexical{Plain/Rich}TextPlugin` and `DEPRECATED_use{Plain/Rich}TextPlugin` no longer create a ParagraphNode for you. This logic has been decoupled into a separate plugin <BootstrapPlugin />. The Bootstrap plugin also accepts an initialPayloadFn and clearEditorFn for custom initialization (i.e. edit behavior from server data). `<BootstrapPlugin /> <RichTextPlugin .. />`. If you're using the `DEPRECATED_{Plain/Rich}Text` version you may also want to copy-paste this hook and run it before the RichText initialization - https://github.com/facebook/lexical/blob/main/packages/lexical/src/__tests__/utils/DEPRECATED__useLexicalBootstrap.js
- Bugfixes.
