 * Announces automatic links through the {@link AriaLiveRegionExtension} sink.
 *
 * Typing a web address turns it into a link on its own, partway through typing
 * it, with no keystroke to confirm and nothing inserted. A screen reader says
 * nothing, so the user has no way to know a link now exists.
 *
 * A creation paired with a destruction in the same update is not announced.
 * Every keystroke that extends an address rebuilds the link — the old node
 * destroyed and a new one created at once — so announcing every creation would
 * say "Link" at `www.example.c`, again at `o`, and again at `m`. Only a
 * creation on its own is a link that was not there a moment ago.
