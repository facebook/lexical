[feature] Block handles for showing blocks to a model: `$getBlockHandle(node)` gives a block a short opaque handle, the shortest prefix (at least 4 characters, like a short git hash) of a 64-bit hash of its id that no other block's hash starts with, so handles stay short and typo-safe whatever the ids look like, `$getBlockHandles()` gives every block's, and `$resolveBlockHandle(handle, {read})` finds the block again (with `read`, the handles the model was shown, the block it named in that read, while it exists), returning `found`, `not-found`, `ambiguous` (with the candidates' handles) or `invalid` (`too-short` or `malformed`) instead of throwing; `BlockIdHTMLConfig.export` widens from `boolean` to `boolean | 'handle'`, and `'handle'` writes `data-block-handle` (`BLOCK_HANDLE_ATTRIBUTE`) instead of `data-block-id`

A handle costs about 3 to 4 o200k tokens where a 21-character id costs about 14. Handles are derived from the stored ids and never stored; ids, `$getBlockById`, `export: true` and HTML import are unchanged, and import never reads `data-block-handle`.

Types: `BlockIdHTMLConfig.export` (and the `export` output signal) widens from `boolean` to `boolean | 'handle'`; code that reads it as a boolean should treat `'handle'` as on.
