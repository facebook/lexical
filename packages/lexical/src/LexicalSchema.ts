 * that is what the union is about to do with the value. A member reached
 * through a demotion still fits the way it fits: `union[stringValue(),

/**
 * Combinator for a value whose domain is the union of several schemas, such as
 * a dimension that is either a number or the literal `'inherit'`. The domain
 * is inferred as the union of the members' value types; annotate the result
 * when you want to assert a narrower intended domain instead.
 *
 * A {@link SerializationSchema} is total — it always returns a value, falling
 * back to its own default rather than reporting a rejection — so a member is
 * considered to accept `value` when parsing it lands anywhere *other* than that
 * member's default, or when the value is itself that default (the one case a
 * total schema cannot distinguish from a fallback).
 *
 * Selection is in two passes. The first asks every member whether it accepts
 * the value *entirely* — every element of an array, every declared field of an
 * object — and the first such member wins. Only if none does are the members
 * asked again for a partial match, where the first accepting one wins and the
 * union yields what it parsed. So a member that normalizes its input
 * ({@link numberValue} reading a stringified number) composes here the same way
 * it behaves alone, and a value that belongs entirely to a later member is not
 * taken by an earlier one that would only partly coerce it — declaration order
 * decides between members that fit equally well, not between a complete fit and
 * a partial one. If no member accepts at all, the result is `defaultValue` when
 * given, otherwise the first member's default.
 *
 * The inference above is only the fallback. A member that declares its own
 * domain — which every combinator here does — is asked directly, and that is
 * the only way to recognize a value it normalizes
 * *into* its own default (`numberValue()` reading `'0'`). A member whose
 * `defaultValue` lies outside its own constrained domain
 * (`numberValue(0, {min: 1})`) is therefore declined for that value rather
 * than accepting it, and the union falls through to the next member.
 *
 * The result is itself a member of the union in both respects: it declares an
 * `accepts` that asks each member in turn, so a union nested in another union
 * (or reached through a wrapper) keeps its domain, and an `isEqual`, so a union
 * over a reference-typed member still compares by content.
 *
 * That equality is a structural comparison, not a member's own: a union picks a
 * member by what each *accepts*, and {@link transformValue} accepts one domain
 * and produces another, so which member produced a value is not something a
 * union can recover. {@link arrayValue} and {@link objectValue} compare
 * element-wise and field-wise, which is what this does, so a union over either
 * is unaffected. A **custom `isEqual` passed to `transformValue` is not
 * consulted through a union** — two values it would call equal are reported as
 * different, so a property holding one is written out instead of compacted
 * away, `optional({omitDefault})` around the union keeps it instead of
 * dropping it, and as a `createState` parse its `NodeState.toJSON()` writes the
 * value rather than omitting it, `$getStateChange` reports a change, and an
 * updater-form `$setState` performs the write. (A plain-value `$setState`
 * compares nothing either way.) Never the reverse, which would discard the
 * difference. Outside a union the comparator is used as declared.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const parseDimension = unionValue([numberValue(), enumValue(['inherit'])], 'inherit');
 * //    ^? SerializationSchema<number | 'inherit'>
 * parseDimension(640);       // 640
 * parseDimension('640');     // 640 (numberValue reads a stringified number)
 * parseDimension('inherit'); // 'inherit'
 * parseDimension('banana');  // 'inherit' (no member accepts it)
 * ```

 * into the target domain, so the node's setter only ever sees normalized
 * values.
 *
 * `transform` must be pure and total over `inner`'s outputs: it runs once

 *
 * `inner`'s {@link SerializationSchema.isEqual | isEqual} is *not* inherited:
 * it compares values of `inner`'s domain, and the transformed domain may be a
 * different type entirely. Pass `{isEqual}` when the output domain is
 * reference-typed, or a transformed array/object property can never compact
 * away and, used as a `createState` parse, dirties its node on every write of
 * an equal value.
 *
 * A comparator passed here is used wherever this schema is used directly, but
 * is *not* consulted when the schema is a {@link unionValue} member: a union
 * selects by what a member accepts, and this accepts `inner`'s domain while
 * producing another, so it cannot tell which member made a value and compares
 * structurally instead. The effect is a stricter answer than yours — a value
 * you would call the default is written out rather than compacted away — never
 * a looser one.
 *
 * Only then: an equality is for a domain `===` cannot compare, so declaring
 * one over a primitive output is an error. `===` already answers there, and a

 * after which the compact form omits whichever is not the default and parsing
 * restores the default in its place. A rotation compared modulo 360 serializes

 * importing assigns it, with no method call on either side — and no version
 * resolution either way, since the node being parsed into is writable by
 * construction and the node being exported is one the walk already resolved
 * from the EditorState. Because the name is recorded on the schema, an introspecting
 * tool (a codegen pass emitting a specialized parser for a hot node type) can
 * see that a property is a plain field and compile it to a direct assignment.
 * Use {@link withAccessors} with a `{field}` on one side only when the two
 * directions differ — reading the field but writing through a method that
 * normalizes, as TableCellNode's `headerState` does.
 *
 * The trade-off is that a field access is exactly that: normalization,
 * validation or bookkeeping a `set<Prop>` method would do is skipped, and a
 * subclass override of that method is not consulted. Use it when the property
 * really is the field — which is also what makes it safe to compile away.
 *
 * Each direction still stands in for an accessor, so a subclass that overrode
 * one still decides; see {@link SchemaFieldBase.method}. That accessor is the
 * conventional `get<Prop>`/`set<Prop>` unless `getter`/`setter` name a
 * different one, so most declarations need neither — name one only where the
 * accessor is spelled differently, as TextNode's `text` is (`getTextContent`).
 * A node with no such method defers to nothing, which needs no declaring.
 *
 * `decode`/`encode` declare a property whose stored and serialized forms
 * differ ({@link SchemaGetterField.decode} / {@link SchemaSetterField.encode}),
 * and `when` names the predicate gating the export direction
 * ({@link SchemaGetterField.when}).
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * nodeSchema<TextNode>()({
 *   // TextNode's own field in both directions, deferring to getStyle/setStyle
 *   // for a subclass that overrides either — neither is spelled here, since
 *   // both are the conventional name for a `style` property.
 *   style: withField(stringValue(), {field: '__style'}),
 *   // LinkNode's own field, standing in for getURL/setURL rather than the
 *   // getUrl/setUrl the property name would derive.
