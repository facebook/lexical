This doesn't work with Tailwind 4 in the stackblitz environment yet so this is
copied into src/stackblitz-workaround/stackblitz-workaround.ts

See also: https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18418

In a normal project this would probably look like:
@source "../node_modules/lexical-tailwind"
*/
@source "../../../packages/lexical-tailwind/src/index.ts";
