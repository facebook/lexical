/**
 * @experimental
 *
 * Mounts a host's named slot into the host's React-rendered chrome. The
 * reconciler renders every slot subtree synchronously into a hidden
 * placeholder container; attach the returned ref to the element where the
 * slot should live and this hook moves the container there after each
 * render, before paint, revealing it. It re-runs
 * every render and is idempotent (a React wrapper over the
 * framework-independent {@link mountSlotContainer}), so a slot added after
 * the host's first render — or a container recreated by a remove/re-add —
 * is picked up without extra wiring. On unmount (or a nodeKey/slotName
 * change) the previous container is parked back in its host DOM as a hidden
 * placeholder via {@link unmountSlotContainer}.
