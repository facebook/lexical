// @vitest-environment node

// Deterministic randomized runs: 3 peers, every delivery mode, typing,
// formats, links, comments, lists, tables, containers, undo and redo. Each
// seed checks convergence, a fresh reader, canonical shape, the self-check,
// and that no typed text is lost or duplicated.
//
// Longer runs: FUZZ_SEED_START=1 FUZZ_SEEDS=10000 FUZZ_GC_SEEDS=2500.
// One seed with its op trace: FUZZ_SEED=123 (add FUZZ_GC=1 for gc).
// Differential: the same scripts on the default v2 layout of @lexical/yjs
// (Yjs 13): FUZZ_DIFF=1 with the same seed variables. Two checks per seed:
// - absolute, on @lexical/y's full script: no divergence, exception,
//   fragmented token, self-check warning, fresh-reader mismatch or recovered
//   read or write;
// - relative: @lexical/y never loses or duplicates more tokens, diverges,
//   throws or splits a token where v2 does not. Ops pick their targets in
//   the current document, so the pair is compared on the script cut before
//   the first op the two runs resolved differently. Text typed into a
//   container a peer removed, which v2 keeps only by bringing back deleted
//   content, is not counted as lost (resurrectionExcuse).
// Run the relative check with FUZZ_NO_MOVE=1 (add FUZZ_GC=1 for gc): with
// block moves on, the move limit below makes @lexical/y worse than v2 on
// about 0.5% of seeds, while the absolute check still holds.
//
// Not checked here (documented limits): block moves (a move is a delete and
// a reinsert, so a concurrent edit of the moved block can duplicate or lose
// it), and text typed inside a container a peer removed (delete wins).
