# `lexical`

Lexical is an extensible JavaScript text-editor that provides reliable, accessible and performant typing experiences for the web.

The `lexical` package contains only the core Lexical engine. This package is intended to be used in conjunction with packages that wire Lexical up to applications, such as `lexical-react`.
