# `@lexical/rich-text`

This package provides a starting point for Lexical users by registering listeners for a set of basic commands that cover simple text-editing behavior such as entering text, deleting characters, copy + paste, or changing the selection with arrow keys. It also provides default behavior for rich text features, such as headings, formatted, text and blockquotes.

You can use this package as a starting point, and then add additional command listeners to customize the functionality of your editor. If you don't want or need rich text functionality, you may want to consider using [@lexical/plain-text](https://lexical.dev/docs/packages/lexical-plain-text) instead.
