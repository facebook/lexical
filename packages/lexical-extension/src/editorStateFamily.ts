/**
 * A family of EditorStates is a set of versions of one document — the current
 * state of an editor and the entries of its undo and redo stacks, say.
 *
 * Serializing each of those states on its own (with `toJSON()`) and parsing
 * each one back (with `parseEditorState`) is lossy in two ways that matter:
 *
 * - **Structural sharing is lost.** Lexical clones only the nodes an update
 *   touches, so consecutive versions of a document share nearly all of their
 *   node objects. Independently parsed states share none, so the restored
 *   history costs memory proportional to its depth times the size of the
 *   document, where the original cost the size of the document plus its edits.
 * - **Key stability is lost.** `parseEditorState` mints a fresh NodeKey for
 *   every node, so independently parsed versions have disjoint key spaces.
 *   Reconciliation is a diff over NodeKeys, so undoing to such a state rebuilds
 *   the whole DOM and remounts every decorator instead of touching what
 *   actually changed.
 *
 * This module serializes a family as one payload instead: a table of the
 * distinct node *versions* across all of the states (a node that several
 * states share appears once), plus, per state, the list of versions its node
 * map is built from. Restoring rebuilds each version once and assembles the
 * node maps from those shared objects, so both properties survive: a node that
 * two states shared before is one object in both again, and every version of a
 * node answers to the same key.
 *
 * The payload is plain data — no `LexicalNode`s, no class references — so it
 * can be handed to another instance of the same module, which is what makes it
 * usable across a hot reload that replaced the node classes.
