# Lexical Agent Guide

This file provides detailed guidance for AI agents and automated tools working with the Lexical codebase.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

### Building
- `pnpm run build` - Build all packages in development mode
- `pnpm run build-prod` - Clean and build all packages in production mode
- `pnpm run build-release` - Build production release with error codes
- `pnpm run build-types` - Build TypeScript type definitions and validate them

### Testing
- `pnpm run test-unit` - Run all unit tests (Vitest, jsdom)
- `pnpm run test-unit-watch` - Run unit tests in watch mode
- `pnpm run test-browser` - Run browser-mode unit tests (Vitest + Playwright, real browser)
- `pnpm run test-browser-watch` - Run browser-mode tests in watch mode
- `pnpm run test-e2e-chromium` - Run E2E tests in Chromium (requires dev server running)
- `pnpm run test-e2e-firefox` - Run E2E tests in Firefox

For E2E testing workflow:
1. Start the dev server: `pnpm run start` (or `pnpm run dev` if you don't need collab)
2. In another terminal: `pnpm run test-e2e-chromium`

### Development Servers

- `pnpm run collab` - Start collab server on localhost:1234

### Code Quality
- `pnpm run lint` - Run ESLint on all files
- `pnpm run lint:fix` - Auto-fix lint issues
- `pnpm run prettier` - Check code formatting
- `pnpm run prettier:fix` - Auto-fix formatting issues
- `pnpm run flow` - Run Flow type checker
- `pnpm run tsc` - Run TypeScript compiler
- `pnpm run ci-check` - Run all checks (TypeScript, Flow, Prettier, ESLint)

### Searching and refactoring

Prefer **ast-grep** over line-oriented regex (`grep`/`sed`) for anything
structural — matching or rewriting imports, call sites, JSX, type
annotations, etc. Regexes miss multi-line forms (a symbol on its own line
inside a multi-line `import { ... }` block) and produce false positives
(`IS_APPLE` matching inside `IS_APPLE_WEBKIT`); ast-grep matches the syntax
tree, so it does neither.

It isn't a dependency, so run it via npx (the CLI binary is `ast-grep`, not
the shadow-utils `sg` that may be on `PATH`):

```sh
# Find every import of something from '@lexical/utils' (ts and tsx are
# separate grammars, so pass -l for each; add --json=compact to post-process)
npx --package @ast-grep/cli ast-grep run \
  -p "import { \$\$\$NAMES } from '@lexical/utils'" -l ts packages
```

Metavariables (`$NAME`, `$$$LIST`) capture nodes for reporting or rewriting
with `--rewrite`. Reach for it whenever a change spans many files and must be
precise — e.g. moving symbols that `@lexical/utils` merely re-exports back to
a direct `lexical` import.

### Tree-shaking annotations

Module-scope calls to the side-effect-free factories (`defineExtension`,
`configExtension`, `safeCast`, `createCommand`, `createState`,
`defineImportRule`, etc.) must be annotated with `/* @__PURE__ */` so
bundlers can drop unused definitions from application bundles. This is
enforced (with an autofixer) by the
`@lexical/internal/require-pure-annotation` ESLint rule — run
`pnpm run lint:fix` (also run by the pre-commit hook) to insert the
annotations automatically. When adding a new factory of this kind,
annotate its definition with `@__NO_SIDE_EFFECTS__` and add its name to
the rule's default list in
`packages/lexical-eslint-plugin-internal/src/rules/require-pure-annotation.js`.

## High-Level Architecture

### Core Concepts

Lexical is built around several key architectural concepts that work together:

**Editor Instance** - Created via `createEditor()`, wires everything together. Manages the EditorState, registers listeners/commands/transforms, and handles DOM reconciliation.

**EditorState** - Immutable data model representing the editor content. Contains:
- A node tree (hierarchical structure of LexicalNodes)
- A selection object (current cursor/selection state)
- Fully serializable to/from JSON

**`$` Functions Convention** - Functions prefixed with `$` (e.g., `$getRoot()`, `$getSelection()`) can ONLY be called within:
- `editor.update(() => {...})` - for mutations
- `editor.read(() => {...})` - for read-only access
- Node transforms and command handlers (which have implicit update context)

This is similar to React hooks' restrictions but enforces synchronous context instead of call order.

**Double-Buffering Updates** - When `editor.update()` is called:
1. Current EditorState is cloned as work-in-progress
2. Mutations modify the work-in-progress state
3. Multiple synchronous updates are batched
4. DOM reconciler diffs and applies changes
5. New immutable EditorState becomes current

**Node Immutability & Keys** - All nodes are recursively frozen after reconciliation. Node methods automatically call `node.getWritable()` to create mutable clones. All versions of a logical node share the same runtime-only key, allowing node methods to always reference the latest version from the active EditorState.

### Monorepo Structure

This is a monorepo with packages in `packages/`:

**Core Packages:**
- `lexical` - Core framework (Editor, EditorState, base nodes, selection, updates)
- `@lexical/react` - React bindings (LexicalComposer, plugins as components)
- `@lexical/headless` - Headless editor for server-side/testing

**Feature Packages** (extend core with nodes/commands/utilities):
- `@lexical/rich-text` - Rich text editing (headings, quotes, etc.)
- `@lexical/plain-text` - Plain text editing
- `@lexical/extension` - Extend editor functionality
- `@lexical/list` - List nodes (ordered/unordered/checklist)
- `@lexical/table` - Table support
- `@lexical/code` - Code block with syntax highlighting
- `@lexical/link` - Link nodes and utilities
- `@lexical/markdown` - Markdown import/export
- `@lexical/html` - HTML serialization
- `@lexical/history` - Undo/redo
- `@lexical/yjs` - Real-time collaboration via Yjs
- And many more...

**Development Packages:**
- `lexical-playground` - Full-featured demo application
- `lexical-website` - Docusaurus documentation site

### Key Architectural Patterns

**Extensions** - Extensions should be used to add features and configuration
to an editor. The set of extensions in an editor must be determined when the
editor is created with `buildEditorFromExtensions`. Extensions with
functionality that can be toggled on or off typically have a `disabled`
configuration property and output signal that defaults to `false`. See the
lexical-extension package and the supporting code in lexical for
more examples and implementation details.

```tsx
export interface MyConfig {
  disabled: boolean;
}
export const MyExtension = defineExtension({
  build: (_editor, config, _state) => namedSignals(config),
  config: safeCast<MyConfig>({ disabled: false }),
  name: '@lexical/docs/My',
  nodes: () => [MyNode],
  register: (editor, _config, state) => {
    const {disabled} = state.getOutput();
    return effect(() => {
      if (!disabled.value) {
        return editor.registerUpdateListener(({editorState}) => {
          // React to updates
        });
      }
    })
  },
})
```

**Plugin System (React)** - Plugins are a legacy pattern for React components
to hook into the editor lifecycle, extensions should be preferred for new code:
```jsx
function MyPlugin() {
  const [editor] = useLexicalComposerContext();
  useEffect(() => {
    return editor.registerUpdateListener(({editorState}) => {
      // React to updates
    });
  }, [editor]);
  return null;
}
```

**Command Pattern** - Commands are the primary communication mechanism:
- Create with `createCommand()`
- Dispatch with `editor.dispatchCommand(command, payload)`
- Handle with `editor.registerCommand(command, handler, priority)`
- Handlers propagate by priority until one stops propagation

**Node Transforms** - Registered via `editor.registerNodeTransform(NodeClass, transform)`. Called automatically during updates when nodes of that type change. Have implicit update context.

**Listeners** - All `editor.register*()` methods return cleanup functions for easy unsubscription.

## Type System

This codebase uses **both TypeScript and Flow**:
- Source files are primarily TypeScript (`.ts`, `.tsx`)
- Flow type definitions are generated in `packages/*/flow/` directories
- Run `pnpm run flow` to check Flow types
- Run `pnpm run tsc` to check TypeScript types
- Both are checked in CI via `pnpm run ci-check`

When adding/modifying APIs, types must be maintained for both systems.

## Backwards Compatibility

**All changes MUST be backwards compatible.** Lexical is a widely-adopted OSS library, and breaking changes ripple out to every downstream consumer.

- Do NOT remove or rename existing public APIs, exported functions, types, or `$` functions. Add new APIs alongside the old ones instead.
- Do NOT change the signature, return type, or behavior of existing public APIs in ways that could break callers. Prefer additive, optional parameters.
- Preserve the serialization format of `EditorState` and node JSON. Serialized content produced by older versions must continue to deserialize correctly.
- If an API genuinely must change, deprecate the old one first (keep it working, document the replacement) rather than removing it outright.
- When in doubt, assume external code depends on the current behavior and keep it intact.

## Important Development Notes

### Reconciliation and Updates
- `editor.read(...)`  or `editor.read('force-commit', ...)` flushes pending updates first, then provides consistent reconciled state
- `editor.read('pending', ...)` reads the pending state (like `editor.update(...)`, but read-only)
- `editor.read('latest', ...)` reads the latest consistent reconciled state
- Inside `editor.update()`, you see pending state (transforms/reconciliation not yet run)
- `editor.getEditorState().read()` always uses latest reconciled state, but prefer `editor.read('latest', ...)` in new code
- Updates can be nested: `editor.update(() => editor.update(...))` is allowed but strongly discouraged
- Do NOT nest updates in reads, or use a force-commit in an update

### Node References
Always access node properties/methods within read/update context. Nodes automatically resolve to their latest version via their key. Don't store node references across update boundaries.

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests** - Vitest (jsdom), located in `packages/**/__tests__/unit/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}`
- **Browser tests** - Vitest browser mode driven by the Playwright runner, located in
  `packages/**/__tests__/browser/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}`. Use these for behavior that depends on
  a real layout/selection engine instead of stubbing the missing jsdom functionality from
  `vitest.setup.mts` (e.g. `Range.getBoundingClientRect`, the Selection API). Run with
  `pnpm run test-browser`; the browser set is controlled by the `VITEST_BROWSER` env var
  (comma-separated, default `chromium`). Prefer building editors with the extension APIs
  (`buildEditorFromExtensions`, or `LexicalExtensionComposer`/`LexicalExtensionEditorComposer`
  in React).
  - **Do not use `using`/`Disposable` in browser tests (or any browser-facing code).**
    Explicit Resource Management (`using`, `Symbol.dispose`, `Disposable`) is not supported
    in WebKit/Safari yet, so the syntax throws a `SyntaxError` there. `using` is fine in unit
    tests (jsdom/Node), but browser tests should clean up with
    `onTestFinished(() => editor.dispose())` instead — `editor.dispose()` is a plain method
    available on the result of `buildEditorFromExtensions`.
- **E2E tests** - Playwright, located in `packages/lexical-playground/__tests__/e2e/**/*.spec.{ts,mjs}`
- E2E tests require the playground dev server running
- Use `pnpm run debug-test-e2e-chromium` to debug E2E tests with browser UI

### Custom Nodes
When creating custom nodes:
1. Extend a base node class (TextNode, ElementNode, DecoratorNode)
2. Implement instance methods: `$config()`, `createDOM()`, `updateDOM()`
3. Register with extension or editor config: `nodes: [YourCustomNode]`
4. Export a `$createYourNode()` factory function (follows $ convention)

### Shadow DOM and iframe realm safety

Lexical supports editors whose root element lives inside a Shadow DOM or an
`<iframe>` document. The editor resolves its `window` and `document` from
`rootElement.ownerDocument.defaultView`, so code that reaches for the **global**
`window` or `document` will silently use the wrong realm when the editor crosses
a frame boundary. Shadow DOM adds a second hazard: the browser **retargets**
selection and focus reads to the shadow host, hiding the real nodes.

Use the shadow/iframe-aware helpers exported from `lexical` instead of the raw
browser globals:

| Instead of | Use | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `window` | `element.ownerDocument.defaultView` or `getDefaultView(element)` (@internal) | Returns the window that owns the element |
| `window.getSelection()` | `getDOMSelection(rootElement.ownerDocument.defaultView)` | Reads selection from the correct window |
| `selection.getRangeAt(0)` | `getDOMSelectionRange(selection, rootElement)` | Unwraps retargeted shadow-DOM selection |
| `document` in `createDOM`/`updateDOM`/`exportDOM` | `$getDocument()` | Returns the document that owns the editor root (falls back to `globalThis.document`) |
| `document` elsewhere | `getRootOwnerDocument(rootElement)` or `element.ownerDocument` | Returns the document that owns a specific element |
| `document.activeElement` | `getActiveElement(element)` / `getActiveElementDeep(document)` | Walks through shadow roots to find the real focused element |
| `event.target` | `getComposedEventTarget(event)` | Returns the un-retargeted target for composed events |
| `element.parentElement` | `getParentElement(element)` | Crosses shadow boundaries correctly |
| `selection.anchorNode` / `focusNode` | `getDOMSelectionPoints(selection, rootElement)` | Returns un-retargeted boundary points |

Two ESLint rules enforce the globals rows at lint time:
- `no-restricted-syntax` (error) catches all `document.*` and `window.*` member access in library sources.
- `@lexical/no-document-in-dom-methods` (error, with autofix) catches `document.*` specifically inside `createDOM`/`updateDOM`/`exportDOM` methods and autofixes to `$getDocument().*`.

The remaining rows involve local variable properties that lint cannot reliably detect, so they must be caught in code review.

For full details on the browser platform APIs involved, see
[Shadow DOM and iframes](packages/lexical-website/docs/concepts/shadow-dom.md).

### Commits and Pull Requests
- Write every commit message to match `.github/pull_request_template.md` so it can seed a PR directly: a `[Affected Packages] PR Type: title` subject line, then the `## Description` and `## Test plan` (Before/After) sections.

### Build System
- Uses Rollup for bundling
- Build script: `scripts/build.mjs`
- Supports multiple build modes: development, production, www (Meta internal)
- TypeScript source → compiled to CommonJS and ESM
- Package manager logic in `scripts/shared/packagesManager.mjs`

### Commit and PR Hygiene for Agents
This is an open source project: never include agent-session URLs or other
private/team-internal links (e.g. `https://claude.ai/code/session_...`) in
commit messages, PR titles, or PR bodies. Those URLs are private to the
person or team that ran the session and are meaningless or misleading to
everyone else. Co-authorship attribution (e.g. `Co-Authored-By:`) is fine.
For Claude Code this is enforced mechanically via `attribution.sessionUrl:
false` in the checked-in `.claude/settings.json`; agents from other vendors
should follow this rule as written.
