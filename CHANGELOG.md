## 0.1.11 (February 24, 2022)

- The editor now natively supports read only mode. Use `editor.setReadOnly(boolean)` and `editor.isReadOnly()` to find the read only mode.
- An additional listener has been added to support listening to readonly changes. Use `editor.registerListener('readonly', value => {... })` to react to read only mode changes.

## 0.1.8 (February 11, 2022)

- `Lexical{Plain/Rich}TextPlugin` and `DEPRECATED_use{Plain/Rich}TextPlugin` no longer create a ParagraphNode for you. This logic has been decoupled into a separate plugin <BootstrapPlugin />. The Bootstrap plugin also accepts an initialPayloadFn and clearEditorFn for custom initialization (i.e. edit behavior from server data). `<BootstrapPlugin /> <RichTextPlugin .. />`. If you're using the `DEPRECATED_{Plain/Rich}Text` version you may also want to copy-paste this hook and run it before the RichText initialization - https://github.com/facebook/lexical/blob/main/packages/lexical/src/__tests__/utils/DEPRECATED__useLexicalBootstrap.js
- Bugfixes.
