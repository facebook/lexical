# Node Replacement Example

A rich text editor built with extensions (`RichTextExtension`, `HistoryExtension`, and `AutoFocusExtension`) that uses node replacement to swap every `ParagraphNode` for a `CustomParagraphNode`. The replacement is declared in the `nodes` of `CustomParagraphExtension`.

**Run it locally:** `pnpm i && pnpm run dev`
