 * A NodeCaret is the combination of an origin node and a direction

 * (using next or previous as direction, for symmetry with SiblingCaret).
 *
 * The differences between NodeCaret and PointType are:
 * - NodeCaret can only be used to refer to an entire node (PointCaret is used when a full analog is needed). A PointType of text type can be used to refer to a specific location inside of a TextNode.
 * - NodeCaret stores an origin node, type (sibling or child), and direction (next or previous). A PointType stores a type (text or element), the key of a node, and a text or child offset within that node.
 * - NodeCaret is directional and always refers to a very specific node, eliminating all ambiguity. PointType can refer to the location before or at a node depending on context.
 * - NodeCaret is more robust to nearby mutations, as it relies only on a node's direct connections. An element Any change to the count of previous siblings in an element PointType will invalidate it.
 * - NodeCaret is designed to work more directly with the internal representation of the document tree, making it suitable for use in traversals without performing any redundant work.
 *
 * The caret does *not* update in response to any mutations, you should
 * not persist it across editor updates, and using a caret after its origin
 * node has been removed or replaced may result in runtime errors.
