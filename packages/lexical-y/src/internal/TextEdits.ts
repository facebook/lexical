// Which characters of a line a commit kept. Lexical records, while the
// binding is attached, every change of a text node's text (a splice with its
// offsets, as typing and deleting make them; a split; a merge; a text set
// whole), every node the selection deletes, and every node inserted into or
// removed from an element's children, in order (EditorState#_textEdits).
// Replayed over the previous state, they give each character of each line
// its identity: an old character, or new.
//
// In flat storage, a node's type, format, link and segment key are
// attributes of its characters: which node holds a character is not its
// identity, its place in the line is.
//
// Invariant: an edit the record places exactly (a splice, a node the
// selection deletes) is written where it was made: the text it inserts is
// new, the text it deletes is gone. The old characters the record keeps in
// place, in order, pin the line; between two pins, what the record does not
// place (a node removed, made, replaced, moved, wrapped or unwrapped by app
// code or a transform; a text set whole, whose offsets are not known) is
// resolved by the diff a write makes without the record (see stretch): the
// text that left there and the text that arrived, aligned by their common
// start and end, in whole words, anchored at the caret. Why: transforms
// swap nodes without changing the line's text (a hashtag or keyword made of
// a part and made plain again, an entity grown by its neighbour's text, a
// range wrapped in a link), which says nothing of which characters the new
// nodes hold, and a guess per node lost characters next to equal text, so a
// peer's concurrent delete there came back. Where the record does not
// explain a line's text, the line has no identities, and the writer diffs it
// as before the record.
//
// Text entity transforms also record text they move into the previous node
// (a move) and text they remake in a node of another type (a retype): that
// text keeps its identities there, as an edit the record places does.

   * text, the text a set replaced) and the text that arrived there (a text
   * set, a node made), each in line order, are aligned by the diff a write
   * makes without the record (see diffStrings and snapToWords: their common
   * start and end, in whole words, anchored at the caret where it is in the
   * text aligned and in a node that was there before; a node made in this
   * commit has the caret where whatever made it put it). What it aligns
   * keeps its identity; the rest that arrived is new, and the rest that
   * left is deleted. Invariants:
   * 1. Only pins split a line. Text an edit the record places inserted
   *    (typed) is new where it is, and old characters it deleted are gone:
   *    neither is in a stretch's text, nor splits it (the record does not
   *    order a node made and a node removed in one place).
   * 2. Set text an edit the record places deleted later in the commit stays
   *    in the text that arrived, where it is: the old characters aligned
   *    with it are deleted (see compose, where a set replaces it again).
   * 3. A set replaces what the record placed in the node before it: typed
   *    text it replaced left (it stays in the text that left, where it was,
   *    and is new: no old character is aligned with it), and nothing is
   *    pinned there any more.
   * 4. Set text aligns with a removed node's text whole or not at all
   *    (where a removed node in front of a node set whole shares nothing
   *    with the new text, the set node's own text is still kept).
   * 5. Text of nodes made aligns with the text that left as y-prosemirror
   *    aligns a text run: as one text each, node boundaries and formats
   *    left out, by their common start and end (see keptEnds), so that a
   *    line made again from its JSON with one word changed writes that word
   *    alone, whichever nodes held its text. An old character it keeps keeps
   *    its Yjs item, which stays deleted where a peer deleted it (an item is
   *    never put back, and the old text is the one the editor showed, see
   *    Unread); only the changed words are written.
   * Priority: the diff runs over all that arrived, in line order, and text
   * that goes on a node's text (a set) keeps what it is aligned with; set
   * text still new is then aligned with what is left between what is kept,
   * and the text of nodes made last, between what is kept, with all of the
   * text that left there, anchored at the caret wherever it is in it (a
   * highlighter that makes a line's tokens again puts it back where the
   * user typed). False where a text in it is not known.
