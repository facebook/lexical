// followUpRanges finds the follow-up's unit with units.indexOf, and
// formatsAt walks the container's items from its start. So its cost grows
// with the follow-up's position, not with the rest of the document. A
// follow-up after each keystroke (BlockIdExtension's naming path) at the
// same block of a document ten times longer costs about the same, while a
// check that read the whole container would cost about ten times as much.
// The two documents are measured in turns, after a warm-up, and compared by
// their medians, so a burst of load or a cold first check lands on both.
