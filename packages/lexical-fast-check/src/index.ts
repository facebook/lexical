/**
 * Derive a fast-check arbitrary for the node-specific properties of `klass`'s
 * serialized JSON, composing the schemas it inherits
 * — so an element-based node generates the properties it gets from ElementNode
 * as well as its own. Spread the result with `type`/`version` to feed
 * `importJSON`. Because each property's schema is the same one the node uses
 * to parse its JSON, the generated values are exactly what the node's parser
 * accepts — a single declaration powers both parsing and example generation.
 *
 * Every property is generated independently as present or absent
 * (`requiredKeys: []`), because that is the domain the parsers actually face:
 * a `SerializedPartial` may omit any node-specific property — older documents
 * predate a property, and a compact export omits one whose value equals its
 * default. Generating complete records only would leave the defaulting path
 * (the whole point of a schema carrying a `defaultValue`) untested.
 *
 * The values are typed as what the class's schemas *accept*, composed across
 * its `$config` chain — not as what they parse to. The two differ wherever a
 * schema reads more than it writes, and this generator produces exactly that
 * difference: an `aliasedValue`'s legacy spellings are in the generated domain
 * (see the `aliased` case below), so a type describing the parsed output would
 * be wrong about the values it hands back.

 * a `nullable(stringValue())` that takes only `#`-prefixed strings still
 * carries `nullable` metadata, so generating from the metadata alone produced
 * values it declines. A round-trip property then failed on values this claimed
 * were in domain, or passed while a sibling union member silently rewrote
