# Lexical Benchmarks

Performance benchmarks for the Lexical core. Run via `pnpm bench` from the
repo root, or scoped to a single project with `--project "bench (bench)"` (data
structure microbenches, node env) or `--project "bench-dom (bench)"` (real-editor
benches, jsdom env).

```sh
pnpm bench                                       # all bench projects
pnpm vitest bench --project "bench (bench)"         # microbenches only
pnpm vitest bench --project "bench-dom (bench)"     # editor cycle benches only
pnpm vitest bench --project "bench (bench)" nodeMap # filter by file substring
```

## Two projects, why?

Microbenches that exercise pure data structures (`Map` vs `GenMap`, etc.)
run in `bench` (node env, no DOM) — fastest startup, cleanest numbers.

Benches that exercise a real Lexical editor (which needs a DOM) run in
`bench-dom` (jsdom env). Files in `__bench__/dom/**` are picked up only
by this project. The two projects share the same `pnpm bench` entry but
otherwise stay isolated to keep microbench results uncontaminated by
jsdom setup cost.

## What benches live here

| File | Project | Measures |
| ---- | ------- | -------- |
| `nodeMap.bench.ts` | `bench` | `Map` vs `GenMap` on clone / typing / paste / iteration / get |
| `getWritable.bench.ts` | `bench` | headless writes, replacement, and selection formatting at fixed document sizes |
| `dom/editorCycle.bench.ts` | `bench-dom` | real `editor.update` cycle cost on a jsdom-backed editor |
| `dom/editorOperations.bench.ts` | `bench-dom` | editor operations: split, format, delete range, paste, select-all |

Helpers shared across files live in `_utils.ts` (microbench) and
`dom/_utils.ts` (real-editor). Use them when you can; extract new helpers
there if your bench file grows beyond a single workload.

For writable-node changes, compare production bundles with the same current
benchmark on every revision:

```sh
node scripts/bench-get-writable.mjs <base-ref> [other-refs...] > results.jsonl
```

The Vitest writable-node benchmark checks both alternating edits during setup
and the final document after timing, so a no-op cannot hide behind the parity
of the last iteration.

The runner applies the shared package-build Babel options (including the
repository's Browserslist targets and production error transform) before
esbuild bundles JavaScript with `target: 'esnext'`. Native class fields are
preserved. The shared Terser settings use ES2021 and two compression passes;
the runner additionally verifies that all development constants are eliminated
before importing the bundle. Every revision uses the same current build options,
so the comparison measures source changes under that configuration, not the
isolated effect of changing build settings. This is a headless source bundle,
not the published package layout or the compiler annotation pipeline.

The runner also includes the working tree. It verifies each workload before
timing, rotates revision order across nine samples, and reports median
microseconds per update plus the individual samples. This reduces timing
drift between separate runs. Measurements cover headless updates without DOM
reconciliation; small differences still need to be treated as noise.
Set `LEXICAL_BENCH_FILTER` to a regular expression over the workload name and
`LEXICAL_BENCH_SAMPLES` to a positive integer for longer, focused comparisons.

## When to add a bench

Add a bench when you are landing a perf change and want to:

- Establish a baseline so future regressions are detectable.
- Justify a non-obvious algorithmic choice with measurements.
- Compare implementation strategies (the `nodeMap.bench.ts` workflow).

Skip a bench for changes whose perf impact is obvious or unmeasurable in
isolation.

## Conventions

**File naming**

- `*.bench.ts` directly under `__bench__/` for node-env microbenches.
- `*.bench.ts` under `__bench__/dom/` for jsdom-env benches.

**Structure** — sweep across realistic sizes; one `test` per scenario;
one `bench` per implementation under test. Vitest 5 provides `bench` through
the test context. Call `.run()` for a single benchmark or `bench.compare()`
for multiple implementations.

```ts
import {test} from 'vitest';

import {buildMap, type FakeNode} from './_utils';
import {MyImpl} from '../MyImpl';

const SIZES = [100, 1000, 10000, 100000] as const;

for (const size of SIZES) {
  test(`size=${size} :: <scenario name>`, async ({bench}) => {
    let oldImpl: Map<string, FakeNode>;
    let newImpl: MyImpl<string, FakeNode>;

    await bench.compare(
      bench(
        'old',
        {
          beforeAll: () => {
            oldImpl = buildMap(size);
          },
        },
        () => {
          // operation under test using oldImpl
        },
      ),
      bench(
        'new',
        {
          beforeAll: () => {
            newImpl = MyImpl.fromMap(buildMap(size));
          },
        },
        () => {
          // operation under test using newImpl
        },
      ),
    );
  });
}
```

**Comparison pattern** — pass both implementations to `bench.compare()` in
one test. Vitest reports their relative performance in a comparison table.

**Setup state** — use the `beforeAll` benchmark option to initialize state
before warmup and again before measured iterations. It does not run for
every iteration. Use `beforeEach` and `afterEach` benchmark options for
per-iteration work outside the timed body. Timing options such as `time`,
`iterations`, and `warmupTime` go in `.run(options)` or the final argument
to `bench.compare()`. Mutations made by the benchmark body accumulate across
iterations unless a hook resets the state.

**DCE prevention** — V8 may eliminate calls whose return values are
unused. Each bench file should declare a module-level scalar sink and
assign into it from the timed body so the call can't be elided:

```ts
let _benchSink: unknown;

test('map lookup', async ({bench}) => {
  await bench('get', () => {
    _benchSink = map.get(someKey);
  }).run();
});
```

For loops, accumulate into a local and assign the local once at the end:

```ts
test('map iteration', async ({bench}) => {
  await bench('iterate', () => {
    let count = 0;
    for (const _ of map) count++;
    _benchSink = count;
  }).run();
});
```

A scalar assignment (rather than an array push) avoids unbounded memory
growth at high iteration counts — e.g. size=100000 `get` can run millions
of iterations per bench cycle.

## Reading results

Vitest reports throughput (ops/sec), latency, percentiles, and relative
performance in each comparison table. Compare implementations within the
same table; mean latency is useful as an absolute number, while high
percentiles indicate tail behavior under GC or compaction.

Sample size and warmup are managed by Vitest. The default heuristics are
fine for stable comparisons between two impls on the same machine; for
absolute numbers you intend to publish, run multiple times and report the
median.

## Limits

- Numbers are **machine-dependent**. Compare runs on the same machine and
  the same load. Don't compare numbers across hardware.
- jsdom DOM ops are slower than real browsers. Treat `bench-dom` numbers
  as relative comparisons, not absolute production estimates.
- Benches do not run in CI today. They are local tools for perf work.
